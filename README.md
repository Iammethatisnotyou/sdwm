# sdwm - Simple Dynamic Window Manager
## inspired by both DWM - Dynamic Window Manager and SXWM - Simple Xorg Window Manager

## Purpose
sdwm mixes the parsing idea from sxwm while maintaining the features from dwm. This allows it to be simple with the good things. Notable things, add the freedom to choose a bar to use. Removes monitor features from sxwm as not everyone uses a second monitor.

## Features
If there is a feature that you want in this window manager, You can customize the C code and recompile the program. The code is meant to be simple and modular.

## Installation

make
sudo make install
```

If you want to remove the program run the following.

```
